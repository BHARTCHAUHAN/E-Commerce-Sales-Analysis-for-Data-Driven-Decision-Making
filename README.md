# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-for-Data-Driven-Decision-Making
This project provides an interactive dashboard for E-Commerce Sales Analysis using RFM Customer Segmentation. The dashboard enables data-driven decision making by visualizing key metrics such as customer distribution by segment, average spend, total sales, and average recency across different customer groups.



## Project Goal

This project is focused on building an interactive dashboard for e-commerce sales analysis using RFM customer segmentation. The dashboard visualizes key business metrics such as profit, orders, net sales, units sold, payment methods, sales by brand, seller, and product performance, and customer segments. Users can filter data by product category, year, month, and shipping city to gain actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard is implemented using Python and Streamlit (or Power BI/Tableau), and includes sample data and clear visualizations for business analytics.
